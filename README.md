# About theme
The main idea for this theme is to create a pleasing User Interface while also staying true to the default look to Discord.

I would like to explicity say, I am quite new to CSS! My only work with CSS is a half finished barebones website, and about 2 weeks (as of 16th October 2020) of messing around with Discord CSS. I would like to say that any majour issues with this theme may take me a while to spot/fix so anyone anxiously waiting for a fix to something, please be patient. :)
