# MaterialCord
## What does it do?
- The aim of MaterialCord is to give Discord a Material aesthetic while still trying to stay true to the vanilla look of the client. What comes with the theme you may ask? With this theme, Discord now has a bubbly/round design to it, and anywhere where vanilla Discord fails to keep a unified design, this theme will rectify it.

## What is the main idea behind this theme?
- The main idea behind this theme is to visualise what Discord could look like if it embraced the new "Material Standard" like other companies have.
